# You're Out!
You play as a landlord with headphones blasting loud, calming lofi music. At the beginning of each day, you sit at your desk checking tenant eviction notice papers and stamping them to the beat of the music. After finishing this paperwork, you walk through the hallways under a time limit and deliver these eviction notices to the correct doors, knocking them to the rhythm for a bonus score.

When the door opens, tenants scream at you, drowned by your music as you type their full legal name. Failing too many keys fills a sympathy bar, which, when full, has you just leave. After all tenants have been delivered to, your score is tallied and the next day arrives, with three days in total.

Each day has faster music, more tenants to deliver to, less time to find them, and your sympathy bar fills much faster so you have less time to type.
